## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue on GitHub
2. Send a detailed report to our security team at [security@yourdomain.com]
3. Include the following in your report:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Full path of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
   - Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the vulnerability

## What to Expect

When you report a vulnerability, you can expect:

1. **Confirmation**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Updates**: We will provide regular updates about our progress
3. **Resolution**: Once the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a fix
4. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate the public disclosure of the vulnerability

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Code Review**
   - All code changes must go through peer review
   - Security-sensitive changes require additional review
   - Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities

2. **Dependencies**
   - Keep all dependencies up to date
   - Regularly check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
   - Use dependency scanning tools in CI/CD pipeline

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Use secure session management
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Follow the principle of least privilege

4. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
   - Use secure hashing algorithms for passwords
   - Implement proper input validation and sanitization

### For Users

1. **Account Security**
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication when available
   - Keep your access tokens secure

2. **API Usage**
   - Never share your API keys
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Rotate keys regularly
